						</header>
						<p>
													We integrate dropship products from the best dropshipping suppliers into one single account. There is no need  to with any supplier.We handle orders & returns with the suppliers for you.
	We strive to meet this goal by simplifying and streamlining product sourcing for the emerging market of millions of web-based entrepreneurs delving into the fray of starting and/or growing a retail business. We actively search for suppliers of new, interesting, and in-demand products to add to our catalog every month.<br />
		We tirelessly strive to create tools and resources to aid our customers in their drive for business growth.
		To help our members be more effective and profitable, we offer a wealth of educational materials to help our members be successful.
		We believe that home-based sellers should have access to the same top-quality suppliers that the big retail stores use.
		We believe new sellers should never have to worry about whether or not they are getting scammed by their "Dropshipper".
										 </p>
													<p>
															Youtopia retailers get instant access to wholesale products from our ever- growing supplier base.
	Rather than working out relationships and contracts with each supplier—and figuring out each's unique requirements and processes—our members have uniform access to all of our suppliers through a single, simple interface.
	Suppliers are able to increase sales and distribution by tapping into the marketing efforts of tens of thousands<br> of web-based retail entrepreneurs of all sizes while simultaneously minimizing the cost and complexity of dealing with low-volume retailers. One integration, thousands of incremental retail outposts.
												 </p>
												<p>It's hard to find real top-level wholesalers by doing searches online. There are just too many lower level middlemen and dropshipping scams advertising and competing for the top results.
	So we go directly to the Manufacturer and find out who the REAL Authorized Distributors are.
	We find out which ones are eager to work with online sellers and more importantly, meet our strict listing requirements</p>
						<p>We take each and every Supplier through a very strict qualification process before we even consider listing them in our Directory.
	Suppliers DON'T pay to get our Seal and Listing, they have to qualify. Even though this step is involved and takes some time, we feel it's extremely important.
	 Our Members NEVER have to worry about putting their customers at risk by using a fake Dropshipper...or pay unnecessary fees by working with middlemen.</p>
												<p>Youtopia handles payments directly, no third party requiredAccept credit cards when you launch your store. Receive alerts when you’re getting paid and even recover lost sales from chargebacks.
	Choose from a number of local currencies and we’ll automatically handle major country and state tax rates.
	The checkout process is simple and secure. Your customers can place their orders quickly and with confidence.</p>
